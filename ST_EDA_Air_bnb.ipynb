        "This project involves performing an analysis on the data having around 49000 observations. The objective is to seek-out meaningful insights from this data to provide crucial information to the management and the stakeholders to make decisions on what can be done to expand or improve the business, eventually leading to the growth of the business. This project will identify the patterns that are being formed in these observations and based on those patterns some suggestions can be taken in consideration. This analysis will help not only the guests to make better choices but it will also be helping the hosts, so that they may make the required changes in order to grow their business. As we are provided with information like:-\n",

        "Data Distributed as per specific neighborhood groups\n",
        "Prices\n",

        "Room Type Preference\n",
        "Using this information we will be able to seek insights like:-\n",

        "Preference of the guests for their hosts\n",
        "Room-Type preference\n",
        "Prefered Price range\n",
        "Most preferred neighborhood\n",
        "We will also be able to create a filter system for our guests to provide them with the listings as per their budget and other preferences, we will be able to rank our hosts as per their ability to match the guests requirement, this way we will be targeting customers with specific needs and we will be fulfilling those needs, which will eventually enhance customer experience, and they will be getting utmost satisfaction when all of their needs will be fulfilled. We will also be able to provide our hosts with the information on what they can change or improve so that they can get more attention and also they will be able to fulfill the needs of their guests.\n",
        "\n",
        "Majorly we will be doing data wrangling using \"pandas\" to frame this data more clearly and seek out meaningful information that can be used to analyze the requirements and the preference of the guests. There might also be a need to create other data frames so that information can be stored separately and can be accessed whenever needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "For computations and calculations on the numerical data we will be using numpy so that we can seek insights mainly for ranking purposes. Numpy will be helping us to create required arrays so that the data can be stored and accessed in a systematic manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to simplify and study the results and the analysis more efficiently, the optimum presentation of the analysis is a must, which makes it easier for the stakeholders to understand the results of the analysis and make informed decisions. In order to achieve this we will be using Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization and for the presentation of the insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now coming onto what I will be learning from this project, as this is a real life situation where I will have to do some research on how things really work in this field I will be getting the knowledge of the working model of this business, along with this I will get an idea on how do we need to think and create solutions for the problems, however identifying problems in any statement is also a skill in itself, this project will also help me to polish those skills as well, talking about data science, I will be learning the optimum utilization of the libraries which will help me to learn how to use the methods provided in the best way possible, I will also be working on critical thinking on how to apply some provided complex concepts on this given data so as to make it more meaningful as if it is telling a story.\n",
